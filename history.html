			<h3 >1950</h3>
			<p>Alan Turing releases "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," where the renowned codebreaker of the Nazi ENIGMA cipher during WWII endeavors to address 
				the query of whether machines can possess cognitive abilities. Turing introduces the Turing Test in an attempt to ascertain if a computer can 
				exhibit comparable intelligence, or at least produce results equivalent to human intelligence. The significance of the Turing test has been a topic of ongoing debate.
