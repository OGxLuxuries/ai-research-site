		    Outputs from data processing do not represent the world but construct it, meaning AI systems cannot
		     generate knowledge that accurately captures an independent reality.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">02</li>
		  <li>
		    Methods of supervised Machine Learning perpetuate existing regularities, hindering social change by
		     neglecting discontinuities or irritations, thus presenting an obstacle to encouraging change.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">03</li>
		  <li>
		    Software developers often lack specific knowledge about the areas where Machine Learning applications 
		    are used, leading to poor assessment of technological consequences; this challenge can be solved with enhanced contextual knowledge.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">04</li>
		  <li>
		    AI systems reflect the values and assumptions of their developers, making the existence of a value-free, 
		    neutral, and objective AI impossible.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">05</li>
		  <li>
		    The high degree of automation in developing intelligent information technologies might alleviate 
		    the current shortage of expert knowledge and talent needed for AI systems.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">06</li>
		  <li>
		    Social acceptance of AI technologies is currently limited, but in the future, broader application
		     areas might become feasible even where social acceptance is lacking today.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">07</li>
		  <li>
		    The alleged automation achieved by AI systems comes with "invisible" costs, including precarious
		     work conditions and environmental impacts.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">08</li>
		  <li>
		    The operation of AI systems is complex infrastructurally and materially, posing uncertainties about
		     the stability, energy, and natural resources future societies can provide for widespread AI implementation.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">09</li>
		  <li>
		    Presently, significant gaps exist between artificial and natural intelligence, but in the future, 
		    AI technologies could potentially function more closely to biological brains.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">10</li>
		  <li>
		    Explainability is a current challenge as many AI applications are too complex for human understanding; 
		    future progress may lead to AI systems providing understandable reasons for their outputs.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">11</li>
		  <li>
		    Current supervised Machine Learning technologies are often fixed on specific application areas, and 
		    future AI systems might achieve flexibility to solve tasks in various domains with less susceptibility to malfunctions.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">12</li>
		  <li>
		    Many Machine Learning methods rely on limited-sized data sets, and this challenge could be addressed
		     in future AI technologies, for example, by utilizing unsupervised Machine Learning techniques.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">13</li>
		  <li>
		    Supervised Machine Learning often requires hand-labeled training data sets lacking complexity; this 
		    challenge is solvable as AI is moving towards techniques that reduce the need for extensive training data sets.
		  </li>
		  <li class="num">14</li>
		  <li>
		    AI systems can be used for both defense and offensive cyber-attacks, and achieving complete 
		    security for AI-based information technologies to eliminate vulnerabilities is considered impossible.
		  </li>
